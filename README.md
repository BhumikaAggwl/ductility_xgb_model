# ductility_xgb_model
# Ductility XGBoost Model

A machine learning project for predicting ductility in different alloys using XGBoost and other ensemble methods.

## Project Overview

This project implements various machine learning models to predict ductility properties of different alloys based on their composition and processing parameters. The primary focus is on XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model performance, with comparisons to other algorithms.
